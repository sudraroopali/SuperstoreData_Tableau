# Superstore Data Visualisation on Tableau

In this Tableau project, I delved into a comprehensive Superstore dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the sales and profit trends of a retail store. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights that could drive informed business decisions. To achieve this, I created a visually appealing and interactive data visualization dashboard using Tableau.

The sales and profit dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of the store's performance, allowing for a thorough analysis of sales trends, profit margins, and key performance indicators. By utilizing interactive visualizations, I enabled users to drill down into specific regions, product categories, and time periods to gain deeper insights into the store's financial performance. Additionally, I developed a separate product dashboard that focused on providing insights into the performance of various products sold. This allowed for the identification of top-selling products, profit contribution by product category, and other relevant metrics. The visualizations presented in this dashboard facilitated a better understanding of the store's product portfolio and helped identify opportunities for improvement and growth.

Through this project, I showcased my proficiency in utilizing Tableau's powerful features to create impactful data visualizations. By transforming complex data into meaningful insights, this project contributed to the generation of actionable recommendations and supported data-driven decision-making within the retail industry.
